During this lab, I was able to deepen my understanding on using pseudo classes and how to style pages to be more user friendly, however; I feel that I still need to really work on increasing my knowledge on targeting specific children of the parent elements, specifically when using the pseudo-class nth-child of etc. Additionally, when it comes to using Favicons and SVG images, I feel that I could really deepen my understanding and when/why to use these instead of IMG files as right now, I don't necessarily understand this particuar concept other than how to include them in the head element of my CSS. 

When it comes to some of my wins, it felt really nice to see my edits come to life in the page; especially with using color to target each specific class in the aside element.
